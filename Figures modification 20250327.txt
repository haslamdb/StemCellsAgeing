Fig 1

B Only show ctrl verus old. Change colors to match the figure. Calculate significance and Bray-Curtis distances (to prove they're significantly different). Will 

D and E : show Rag1 WT and KO and KO transplanted with HSC. Only use young mice but don't label them as young versus old. 

Fig 4 Supplemental. Think of how to change the focus from differences in microbiome composition between experiments but focus on changes between the groups. Can we do a delta between groups as the figure. Can we do venn diagram to show similar species changes per experiment. Could consider doing three different PCA.

Fig 4. Do Venn diagram to show pathways that are differentially regulated in transplanted and old-young mice
Fig 4G look at whether casiene increases abundance of the pyridoxal 5' pathways
